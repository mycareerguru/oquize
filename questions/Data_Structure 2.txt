The memory address of the first element of an array is called
floor address
foundation address
first address
base address
4
The memory address of fifth element of an array can be calculated by the formula
LOC(Array[5]=Base(Array)+w(5-lower bound), where w is the number of words per memory cell for the array
LOC(Array[5])=Base(Array[5])+(5-lower bound), where w is the number of words per memory cell for the array
LOC(Array[5])=Base(Array[4])+(5-Upper bound), where w is the number of words per memory cell for the array

Which of the following data structures are indexed structures?
linear arrays
linked lists
both of above
none of above
1
Which of the following is not the required condition for binary search algorithm?
The list must be sorted
there should be the direct access to the middle element in any sublist
There must be mechanism to delete and/or insert elements in list
none of above
3
Which of the following is not a limitation of binary search algorithm?
must use a sorted array
requirement of sorted array is expensive when a lot of insertion and deletions are needed
there must be a mechanism to access middle element directly
binary search algorithm is not efficient when the data elements are more than 1000.

Two dimensional arrays are also called
tables arrays
matrix arrays
both of above
none of above

A variable P is called pointer if
P contains the address of an element in DATA.
P points to the address of first element in DATA
P can store only memory addresses
P contain the DATA and the address of DATA

Which of the following data structure store the homogeneous data elements?
Arrays
Records
Pointers
None
2 
Each data item in a record may be a group item composed of sub-items; those items which are indecomposable are called
elementary items
atoms
scalars
all of above

The difference between linear array and a record is
An array is suitable for homogeneous data but hte data items in a record may have different data type
In a record, there may not be a natural ordering in opposed to linear array.
A record form a hierarchical structure but a lienear array does not
All of above
4
Which of the following statement is false?
Arrays are dense lists and static data structure 
data elements in linked list need not be stored in adjecent space in memory
pointers store the next data element of a list
linked lists are collection of the nodes that contain information part and next pointer
3
Binary search algorithm can not be applied to
sorted linked list
sorted binary trees
sorted linear array
pointer array

underflow
overflow
housefull
saturated

The situation when in a linked list START=NULL is
underflow
overflow
housefull
saturated
