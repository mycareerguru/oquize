Two main measures for the efficiency of an algorithm are 
Processor and memory
Complexity and capacity
Time and space
Data and space
3 
The time factor when determining the efficiency of algorithm is measured by
Counting microseconds 
Counting the number of key operations
Counting the number of statements
Counting the kilobytes of algorithm
2
The space factor when determining the efficiency of algorithm is measured by
Counting the maximum memory needed by the algorithm
Counting the minimum memory needed by the algorithm
Counting the average memory needed by the algorithm
Counting the maximum disk space needed by the algorithm

Which of the following case does not exist in complexity theory
Best case
Worst case
Average case
Null case
4
The Worst case occur in linear search algorithm when 
Item is somewhere in the middle of the array
Item is not in the array at all
Item is the last element in the array
Item is the last element in the array or is not there at all
4
The Average case occur in linear search algorithm
When Item is somewhere in the middle of the array 
When Item is not in the array at all
When Item is the last element in the array
When Item is the last element in the array or is not there at all

The complexity of the average case of an algorithm is 
Much more complicated to analyze than that of worst case
Much more simpler to analyze than that of worst case
Sometimes more complicated and some other times simpler than that of worst case 
None or above

Arrays are best data structures
for relatively permanent collections of data
for the size of the structure and the data in the structure are constantly changing
for both of above situation
for none of above situation

Linked lists are best suited
for relatively permanent collections of data 
for the size of the structure and the data in the structure are constantly changing
for both of above situation
for none of above situation
2
Each array declaration need not give, implicitly or explicitly, the information about
the name of array
the data type of array
the first data from the set to be stored
the index set of the array
3
The elements of an array are stored successively in memory cells because
by this way computer can keep track only the address of the first element and the addresses of other elements can be calculated
the architecture of computer memory does not allow arrays to store other than serially
both of above
none of above
