When representing any algebraic expression E which uses only binary operations in a 2-tree,
the variable in E will appear as external nodes and operations in internal nodes
the operations in E will appear as external nodes and variables in internal nodes
the variables and operations in E will appear only in internal nodes
the variables and operations in E will appear only in external nodes

A binary tree can easily be converted into q 2-tree
by replacing each empty sub tree by a new internal node
by inserting an internal nodes for non-empty node
by inserting an external nodes for non-empty node
by replacing each empty sub tree by a new external node

When converting binary tree into extended binary tree, all the original nodes in binary tree are
internal nodes on extended tree
external nodes on extended tree
vanished on extended tree
